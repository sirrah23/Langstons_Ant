* Langston's ant
This is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%2527s_ant][Langston's ant]] simulation written in [[https://processing.org/][Processing]].

This code was inspired by Dan Shiffman's [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1EgjgMo48U][video]]. The twist here is that
everytime the ant steps on a non-white cell on the board the cell will
be painted with a random color.
